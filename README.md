# Spam_Detection

Spam messages refer to unsolicited or unwanted messages/emails that are sent in bulk to users. In most messaging/emailing services, messages are detected as spam automatically so that these messages do not unnecessarily flood the users’ inboxes. These messages are usually promotional and peculiar in nature. Thus, it is possible for us to build ML/DL models that can detect Spam messages.

Detecting Spam Emails Using Tensorflow in Python
In this article, we’ll build a TensorFlow-based Spam detector; in simpler terms, we will have to classify the texts as Spam or Ham. This implies that Spam detection is a case of a Text Classification problem. So, we’ll be performing EDA on our dataset and building a text classification model.

Importing Libraries
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn/Wordcloud– This library is used to draw visualizations.
NLTK – Natural Language Tool Kit provides various functions to process the raw textual data.
